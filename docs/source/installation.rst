Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_: the fundamental package for scientific
  computing with Python.
* `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_: a useful manipulation data tool
* `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_: useful for bulding neural networks
* `Seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_: is a really good data visualization library
* `Sklearn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_: useful for the major part of ML applications

Downloading the code
--------------------

The easiest way to get the code is by downloading it from the github realease page
<https://github.com/fededalba/SCcmep2021/releases>`_. 
Unzip the archive in a folder and then you'll need to make sure that the root folder of the repository
is included in the ``$PYTHONPATH$`` environmental variable.
Once you've done that, you'll be able to use the functions simply by importing them.
